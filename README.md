# SodukuSolver
A Soduku Solver program written in GNU Prolog.

I used some of my code from a class assignment to implement my solution, as well as hints/pseudocode from the SWI-Prolog implementation at https://www.metalevel.at/sudoku/.

To run this program, use the GNU Prolog console, and run the sudokuSolver rule as follows:

```
sudokuSolver(X).
```

See ```test.pl``` for sample test cases.
